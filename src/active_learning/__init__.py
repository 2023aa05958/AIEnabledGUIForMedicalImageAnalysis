"""
Active Learning Module for Medical Image Annotation System

This module provides comprehensive active learning capabilities for medical AI models,
combining traditional feedback collection with advanced MONAI-based active learning.

Components:
- feedback_manager: Database and feedback collection system
- performance_analytics: Performance tracking and analysis
- monai_active_learning: MONAI-based uncertainty sampling and active learning
- al_orchestrator: Integration orchestrator combining all AL approaches

Features:
- Uncertainty-based sample selection using Monte Carlo dropout
- Diversity-based sampling for comprehensive training data
- Expert review queue management
- Performance analytics and model comparison
- Real-time uncertainty assessment during inference
